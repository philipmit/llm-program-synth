The error message mentions an invalid decimal literal, which suggests there could be an issue with how the data is being interpreted. Here is the correct code:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    
def train_model():
    # Load data
    ecoli = pd.read_csv('/data/sls/scratch/pschro/p2/data/UCI_benchmarks/ecoli/ecoli.data', delim_whitespace=True, header=None)
    ecoli.columns = ['Sequence Name', 'mcg', 'gvh', 'lip', 'chg', 'aac', 'alm1', 'alm2', 'class']
    X = ecoli.iloc[:, 1:-1]  
    y = ecoli.iloc[:, -1]  
    
    # replace strings with numbers in y
    y = y.replace(list(np.unique(y)), [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
    
    # Split data into training and testing
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y,test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the features
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Train the model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    return model, sc

def predict_label(one_sample, model, sc):
    # Standardize the one_sample to match the data model was trained on
    trained_sample = sc.transform(np.array(one_sample).reshape(1,-1)) # Ensure the sample is reshaped correctly
    # Return the class probabilities as a 1D array
    return model.predict_proba(trained_sample)[0]
```

In this example, I have fixed the SyntaxError by placing the relevant code inside two separate functions - "train_model()" and "predict_label()". The training of the model and the standard scalar are moved to the function "train_model()". It returns both the model and the standard scalar which are fed to "predict_label()" for making predictions. This structure ensures the model and scalar are trained only once and then reused for all following predictions.

Now, when using these functions in the rest of the script, you should first call `model, sc = train_model()` before using the predict_label function as follows: `predict_label(X_test[0], model, sc)`.</Predict>
