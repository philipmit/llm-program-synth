The error suggests a SyntaxError. Seeing that it originates from the predict_label function, I will adjust its definition to prevent the error.

#<TrainAndDefinePredict>
print('********** Train the model using the training data, X_train and y_train')
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print('********** Define a function that can be used to make new predictions with given data')
def predict_label(one_sample):
    # Standardize the one_sample to match the data model was trained on
    trained_sample = sc.transform(np.array(one_sample).reshape(1,-1)) # Ensure the sample is reshaped correctly
    # Return the class probabilities as a 1D array
    return model.predict_proba(trained_sample)[0]
#</TrainAndDefinePredict>

This corrected code will address the 'invalid syntax' issue. The issue was caused by the incorrect reshaping of the sample data provided to the predict_label function. By correctly reshaping the input data we ensure consistent input to the sc.transform() method, as it expects a 2D array.</Predict>
